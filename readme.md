## How to Run through Unity3D

1. Unity3D version should be 2019.1
2. open the files in Unity3D from Unity3D
3. Once open press play and it will switch to game view
4. To start a game press "START" it is ready to be played right away
5. If you want to restart or play a new game after someone won press "NEW GAME"
5. I recomend using visual studio to edit and look at scripts

## Rules

1. You can only play in an area that is lit up and that is not used by another player
2. The first player or "**X**" makes there move in one of the avaiable 3x3 grids
3. The second player or "**O**" makes there move in the corrisponding 3x3 grid 

        IE. If player X made a move in the top left 3x3 at bottom right O would play in the bottom right 3x3 grid
4. As the game goes on the "Subboards" or 3x3 grids will be won players can make moves so that the other player has to "waste" a turn in the already won subbaord
5. The game is won when on player has a 3 in a row on the subboards
